# MD to PDF

This is a python project that converts .MD file to .PDF file.

### To use:
1. Add an `input.md` file in the directory together with 2 script files.
2. Run `markdown-to-pdf-setup-and-run.bat` (for windows users semi-automated run file). It will guide you through all the issues of setting up.
3. If everything is ok you have a new `output.pdf` file in your directory.

Here's an example of how this README.md looks as .PDF
